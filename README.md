### Files

men.zip:                Sound files for men compressed as a pkzip/Winzip file. 16 kHz linear PCM, Windows .wav format.

women.zip:              Ditto for women.

kids.zip:               Ditto for kids.

vowdata.dat:            Acoustic measurements (file format explained at the head of the file). Formants sampled at: (a) steady state, (b) 20% of vowel duration, (c) 50% of vowel duration, and (d) 80% of vowel duration. Text file. See top of file for an explanation of the file format.

bigdata.dat:            Same as 'vowdata.dat', but with finer sampling of the formant contour (every 10% of vowel duration). Text file. See top of file for an explanation of the file format.

vowdata.ds:             Descriptive statistics for acoustic measurements. Text file.

iddata.dat:             Labeling data from 20 listeners. Text file.

misid.dat:              Subset of 'iddata.dat' listing misidentified tokens only; i.e., tokens for which the majority vote was not the vowel intended by the talker. Text file.

timedata.dat:           Vowel start, stop, and steady-state times for each signal. Text file. See top of file for an explanation of the file format.
